# Sales Forecasting using ARIMA

**Project Overview:**
This project guides you through performing sales forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The goal is to predict future sales based on historical data, making data-driven business decisions.

## Getting Started

Data Cleaning
Clean and preprocess historical sales data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure it's in a suitable time series format.

Deseasonalization
Convert seasonal sales data into a non-seasonal format, making it suitable for ARIMA modeling.

ARIMA Model
Select an appropriate ARIMA model by analyzing autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots. Fit the chosen model to the data.

Sales Predictions
Use the fitted ARIMA model to make future sales predictions. Visualize and interpret the results.


### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecast-arima.git
